### F# learning materials and contents from University course
Currently I am learning F# at the university and since this is quite new programming language and I have never learned "proper" functional language... So, I have created one Git repository to record what I have learned day by day and to help other people who are not really familiar with this new programming paradigm -Just like me- :monkey:

I hope this repository helps you learn F# after you finish reading this whole thing. And I also hope I learn a lot by typing the learning contents. I have never done this before but I always have a thought of willing to create a summary note like this.

Well, Good luck! (and wish me luck too please! :joy:)
